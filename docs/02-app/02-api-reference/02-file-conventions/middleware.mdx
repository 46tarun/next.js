The middleware.ts file in Next.js is used to run code on the server before a request is finished. It provides the ability to modify the response based on the incoming request. This can include operations like URL rewriting, redirecting, altering request or response headers, or even sending a direct response.

Middleware executes before the content is served from the cache and before routes are matched. It's particularly useful for implementing custom server-side functionalities like authentication, logging, or handling specific path patterns.

Use the file `middleware.ts` (or .js) in the root of your project to define Middleware. For example, at the same level as pages or app, or inside src if applicable.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts" switcher
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/about/:path*',
}
```

```jsx filename="middleware.js" switcher
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside
export function middleware(request) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/about/:path*',
}
```

## Matcher

[`matcher`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#matcher) allows you to filter Middleware to run on specific paths. For a single path, directly provide the path string. For multiple paths, use an array. For instance, `matcher: ['/about', '/contact']` applies Middleware to both the `/about` and `/contact` paths. Matcher supports full regular expressions, enabling complex patterns like negative lookaheads or specific character matches.

## NextResponse

Middleware can utilize [`NextResponse`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#nextresponse) to enhance route handling capabilities. By returning a `NextResponse` object, you can directly manipulate cookies, set headers, implement redirects, and rewrite paths.

## Runtime

Middleware currently only supports the [Edge runtime](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes). The Node.js runtime can not be used.
